# World Health Causal Analysis

With this project, we analyzed the causal relationships between multiple factors present across most major countries based on the 21st century. 

To run the project just run the following two lines of code in a Unix shell, we utilized Unbuntu 20.04 LTS but it should work for others.

1. docker pull mglevitt/world_happiness_project:run_project
2. docker run mglevitt/world_happiness_project:run_project

The pull should not take too long, but to run the code may take upwards of half an hour as a result of the many computations being made with PC. The end output should be a dictionary of the relations we found that will be printed to your terminal and all the graphs of the relations we found will pop up on your device as the code is run. Feel free to consult us if you run into any difficulties with getting our code to run properly.
